								<h2>Why IT?</h2>
								<p>As technology grows to become a more significant part of our lives, I find importance in learning in how it works. I spend nearly all my time around computers, devices and learning of its ins-and-outs has become an interesting topic while I use it. The more technology improves and advances, the more I ask, how did people figure out how to make it work? How do those game sites I play keep track of so many users’ stats? How does a roomba’s camera memorise the room’s structure? I find fascination in learning how things that we see in our daily lives work. </p>
								<p>Currently, the part of IT that appeals to me the most is programming/website development, as well as technology that will help accessibility to those in need. I’m an avid participant of online games and video games: back when I was younger a lot of my time was spent on sites such as neopets, club penguin, or playing games on consoles such as the Nintendo DS. A lot of these carried over to the present, and I still play different computer games in my free time. Video games are also linked to my other interests; illustration and storytelling. Games in itself are a unique platform to portray a story which includes player choice and input. The mechanics that are able to be programmed play a great part of a story’s impact, and learning how to program an effective game would be something I would like to learn within the courses. </p>
								<p>My other interest in IT comes from hearing from online friends and Youtubers of their experiences with disabilities. With the steady advancement of technology, opportunities to improve accessibility start to arise and I think these opportunity should be taken. Helping out people is another element to what I want to do in the future. Perhaps, there are smarter ard simpler devices we can make to help people deal with disabilities or ways to tweak daily life to make it more accessible. Even aspects of web development can be made to be easier on people with disabilities, such as functions that work in Text-to-speech for blind people, or using typefaces and colours that are easier to read.</p>
 
								<h2>Experience</h2>
								<p>My experience in IT are minimal, with most courses learning the basics of CSS and HTML and classes slightly into how programming works in game. With RMIT, I hope to expand on this knowledge and have a clearer idea of what I would like to do within the IT industry. My biggest aim in my time within this course will most likely revolve around software or website development. Though I come with little knowledge of what Information technology can hold for me, I will keep my options open until I am more familiar with the range of choices I have. My choice in RMIT was also due to the connections that they offer, which can lead to stable, future jobs.</p>
