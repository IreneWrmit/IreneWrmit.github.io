								<h2><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38541235">Job Link</a></h2>
								<p>Hanes Branding is looking for a Junior Front End Developer “to enhance the online user experience for customers.”  Big brands such as Bonds, Champion, and Sheridan are looking for a web developer to improve and manage the sites for these companies. The appeal to this job comes from how it is “front end,”, meaning I would be responsible for the design of the webpages, which something I would be capable and interested in doing for work. It is located in the Melbourne CBD and inner suburbs and provides a good amount of pay in salary, so it makes the job promising for the stable workforce I look for. </p>
								<p>The job looks for a person able to work with a 4+ person team that reports back to the senior Front End Developer. Responsibilities include efficient design skills that can be utilised across multiple platforms. Testing, validation and optimisation for the online content within sites and campaigns, while working with UX designers, back-end developers, content team, among other parts of the company are another part of the work. Experience with testable javascript, web page coding languages such as CSS/HTML, ecommerce websites, and UX design are an important few of requirements for the job. The company also asks for 2+ year experience within a front-end development role.</p>
								<p>Because it asks for CSS and HTML knowledge, I find this job promising. These two coding languages are what I am most currently familiar with, and enjoy thoroughly while using it. My previous studies in High school about communication design, as well as personal artistic interests make me capable for the front-end part of the job, I know what makes something visually work to attract customers and viewers. As I continue my studies in RMIT, other requirements, such as experience in UX design and Javascript can be met.</p>
								<p>To meet the criteria of what the job asks for, I plan to continue my studies in the Bachelor of IT down the line of website and software development. Courses such as Web Programming and other programming courses as well as User-Centered design will be my top priorities in what I learn at my time here. I will likely also search for internships of sorts that will give me the two year experience as a front end designer. While doing so, I will look into other parts within website design, such as the back-end development and digital design in order to have a full understanding to the overall works in the job, making me more capable to work amiably with certain parts of the team. To build on my resume, I may consider looking to different volunteering opportunities or anything that can be added for appeal. In addition, as a hobby, I will continue to study and practice visual design-based works. Though illustration and animation may not exactly be relevant to the job, eye for colour, design and other visual techniques can apply within a front-end job.</p>
