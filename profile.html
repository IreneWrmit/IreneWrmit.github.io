								<h2>Personality types</h2>
								<p>Both personalities seem to highlight the fact the “reserved” and “sensitive” aspects of my personality, the two seemingly having similar results. While descriptions of the “Melancholic” personality is largely negative, critical standards and harsh standards are a distinct feature I carry. I don’t completely perceive this trait as a negative one, however, as perfectionism handled well can turn into a useful tool that can pick out what needs improvement. This critical eye is also what makes a Melancholic analytic; I find myself often looking into how things work in detail as they play through. Combined with the empathy, which the INFP personality talks about, I can easily be someone who can pick up problems and feelings of others. Both tropes also point to being creative and expressive, in which is true while I show through how much art I do in my free time.</p>
								<h2>Learning Style</h2>
								<p>The learning style points to an accurate description; I struggle to take auditory information without a visual cue, and even then I find it hard if there is no rewind button when listening to the information. What I find most effective is to follow instructions while doing it, I remember much more easily that way, and gain a more distinct understanding when I see something play out. Oftentimes, when I tried to learn things on my own, I found that videos which had subtitles and I could follow by doing the actual activity were the best ways I was able to learn. </p>
								<h2>Teamworking</h2>
								<p>Within a team, these characteristics may clash. Being reserved, I may struggle to speak up and contribute if I don’t find the confidence to do so. While I like to stick with the belief that being critical has its benefits, I can easily worry about being too nitpicky, or whether others will find me a bother. On the other hand, I’ve been accused for being too bossy, so sometimes it may be the other way in terms of whoever’s opinions gets drowned out. Overall, I highly value a communicative team where is on equal terms, and can speak freely while being able to resolve disagreements well.</p>
								<p>When forming a team, I’ll make it essential to try include everyone without making it uncomfortable. I’ll attempt to gauge how everyone feels about the group, and try work with it. Keeping myself in check for both talking too much and not talking enough will be something I actively do, and keeping in contact with all team members so that everyone is on the same page and are organised will be another aspect I will try sustain</p>
