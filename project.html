								<h2><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/38541235">Job Link</a></h2>
								<p>My project idea will revolve around the fantasy tabletop roleplay game, Dungeons and Dragons. My aim is to create a site where resources, players stats, and games can be conveniently hosted, as well as making a social networking service in which people who are interested in DND can find each other. Through this site, players will be able to conveniently check information about the RPG and make trackers where any statistics or notes made from the game can be easily kept. In addition, forums, profiles and different types of posts can also be hosted so a community can be created within the website.</p>
								<p>DND is starting to once again rise in popularity, especially in online communities. Many of my friends and I have begun playing it ourselves, and I soon found that there was room for improvement when it came to how mechanics and statistics were tracked. DND is an intricate system, all of which matters for gameplay, but as handwritten sheets, multiple statistics, and different statuses for multiple members come to play, keeping everything in place becomes a disruptive inconvenience. With a site that allows automation and easy management, players can have a better time while roleplaying, and find communities and people to share their passion of DND.</p>
								<p>The site will have a simplistic, and navigable design, while still having images and a theme that can attract the eye. An account will be required in order to log data so users can keep track of their information. People will be able to make sheets for their characters within the site, using a base where an image can be imported. Statistics, items, and other parts of the characters can be typed in, rather than hand written or filled into an image, making the process of updating sheets much easier. They will also have the ability to customise the appearance of their own sheet, such as changing the backdrop or the typeface. </p>
								<p>The site will host a collection of information and links where players can refer back to with ease. Information that users may struggle to find, such as information about weapons, spells, and skills, will all be compiled and set out in a way where they can be easily read and referred back to. Players’ homebrew creations may also be logged and showcased inside the database, whether for the user’s own personal keepings or to share for others to use.</p>
								<p>Another feature of the site would be a group function where the DM and the group can organise their stats and points as they go through campaigns. Chats for the group can be made, having functions for dice rolling and combat built in. DMs will be able to enter the stats of the enemies beforehand, and can have different commands to influence the events. Community collaboration through forums will be another feature to encourage communication and creative sharing.</p>
								<p>The technologies and tools needed for this project will revolve around web development and database management. A program to handle SQL for the data needed to be kept by users, as well as a program to efficiently handle the site’s design. A program like Github will also help working within a team when developing the site, allowing everyone to see the changes and notes needed for the project. Servers will be needed to hosts chats and forums.</p>
								<p>Skills required would come hand in hand with the softwares that are used to create the site. Website developers would need to know SQL, HTML, CSS among other programming languages that are needed throughout the site. Design sense will be needed for any front-end web developers. While implementing many of the mechanics may be tough and need brainwork, overall the project would be quite feasible, as many have already made sites that use chats, randomisers and features similar to what is aimed within the project.</p>
								<p>If the project is successful, players of DND will be able to use a functional site that enhances their gaming experience. More people may be attracted to DND itself as well if these features are more easily accessible despite the complexity of the RPG mechanics. As times goes on, the site can foster a thriving community and aid people so that they can spend less time worrying about rules and spend more time having fun with friends. </p>
